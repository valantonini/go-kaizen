// https://golangdocs.com/rune-in-golang Stings are always defined using characters or bytes. In GoLang, strings are
// always made of bytes. Go uses UTF-8 encoding, so any valid character can be represented in Unicode code points. A
// character is defined using ‚Äúcode points‚Äù in Unicode. Go language introduced a new term for this code point called
// rune.

// Go rune is also an alias of type int32 because Go uses UTF-8 encoding. Some interesting points about rune and strings.
//
// Strings are made of bytes and they can contain valid characters that can be represented using runes.
// We can use the rune() function to convert string to an array of runes.
// For ASCII characters, the rune value will be the same as the byte value.
